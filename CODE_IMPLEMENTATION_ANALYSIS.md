## üìà Progress Indicators

### Positive Signs ‚úÖ
- Strong documentation foundation
- Attendance service near completion
- Good code organization
- Modern tech stack
- Scalable architecture

### Areas of Concern ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Scheduler service has 0% implementation
- 94 TODOs across codebase
- Limited testing coverage (15%)
- Frontend UI gaps in marketing service
- No deployment pipeline

---

## üí° Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Focus on Attendance Service completion** - It's closest to production
2. **Start Scheduler Service** - It's blocking platform completion
3. **Address TODOs** - 94 items need resolution
4. **Increase test coverage** - Currently at 15%

### Strategic Decisions
1. Consider using same tech stack for Scheduler (TypeScript/Supabase)
2. Prioritize MVP features over advanced features
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline early
4. Add monitoring and error tracking
