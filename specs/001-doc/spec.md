## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT the platform provides and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a business stakeholder or development team member, I need a comprehensive understanding of the DOT platform's existing specifications so that I can understand the complete scope of the system, its services, and how they work together to provide value to restaurant businesses.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new team member joins the project, **When** they review the consolidated documentation, **Then** they understand all three services and their business purposes
2. **Given** a stakeholder needs to understand platform capabilities, **When** they read the specification, **Then** they can identify all features and their business value
3. **Given** an architect needs to understand system integration, **When** they review the documentation, **Then** they understand how services interact and share data

### Edge Cases
- What happens when services need to communicate across different authentication systems?
- How does the system handle when one service is down while others are operational?
- What occurs when a restaurant grows from single location to multi-location franchise?
