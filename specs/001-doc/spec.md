# 기능 명세: DOT 플랫폼 종합 문서화

**기능 브랜치**: `001-doc`  
**생성일**: 2025-09-12  
**상태**: 초안  
**입력**: 사용자 설명: "이 doc폴더 안의 모든 문서들을 검토해서 이미 정해져있는 스팩을 문서화해줄 수 있어??"

## 실행 흐름 (main)
```
1. 입력에서 사용자 설명 파싱
   → 추출: 모든 문서 검토 및 기존 명세 통합
2. 설명에서 핵심 개념 추출
   → 식별: 기존 명세, 문서화, 시스템 아키텍처, 서비스들
3. 불명확한 각 측면에 대해:
   → 모든 명세는 여러 파일에 문서화되어 있음
4. 사용자 시나리오 & 테스팅 섹션 작성
   → 문서 검토 및 명세 통합 워크플로우
5. 기능 요구사항 생성
   → 기존 플랫폼 명세의 종합적 문서화
6. 핵심 엔티티 식별 (데이터 관련)
   → 서비스, 데이터베이스, 사용자, 역할, 기능
7. 검토 체크리스트 실행
   → 모든 명세가 캡처되었는지 검증
8. 반환: 성공 (명세 계획 준비 완료)
```

## ⚡ 빠른 가이드라인
- ✅ 플랫폼이 무엇을 제공하고 왜 제공하는지에 집중
- ❌ 구현 방법 회피 (기술 스택, API, 코드 구조 제외)
- 👥  개발자가 아닌 비즈니스 이해관계자를 위해 작성

## 사용자 시나리오 & 테스팅 *(필수)*

### 주요 사용자 스토리
비즈니스 이해관계자나 개발팀 구성원으로서, DOT 플랫폼의 기존 명세를 종합적으로 이해하여 시스템의 전체 범위, 서비스들, 그리고 이들이 어떻게 함께 작동하여 외식업체에 가치를 제공하는지 파악해야 합니다.

### 수락 시나리오
1. **주어진 상황** 새 팀원이 프로젝트에 합류, **동작** 통합 문서를 검토, **결과** 세 가지 서비스와 비즈니스 목적을 이해
2. **주어진 상황** 이해관계자가 플랫폼 역량 이해 필요, **동작** 명세를 읽음, **결과** 모든 기능과 비즈니스 가치를 식별 가능
3. **주어진 상황** 아키텍트가 시스템 통합 이해 필요, **동작** 문서를 검토, **결과** 서비스 간 상호작용과 데이터 공유 방식 이해

### 엣지 케이스
- 서비스들이 서로 다른 인증 시스템을 통해 통신해야 할 때 어떻게 되는가?
- 한 서비스가 다운되고 다른 서비스는 작동 중일 때 시스템이 어떻게 처리하는가?
- 레스토랑이 단일 지점에서 다중 지점 프랜차이즈로 성장할 때 어떻게 되는가?
