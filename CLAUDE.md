# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 🚀 Claude Enhancement Rules

### MANDATORY: Maximize Claude Capabilities
When executing ANY task or command, Claude MUST:

1. **Leverage ALL Available Claude Ecosystem Tools**:
   - **claude-code-templates**: Use for project setup, analytics, health checks
   - **CMAX (Claude Max)**: Multi-instance Claude coordination for parallel AI collaboration
   - **SuperClaude**: Activate specialized personas and behavioral modes
   - **Sub-agents & Global Agents**: Delegate to specialized agents (code-reviewer, test-engineer, performance-engineer)
   - **MCP Servers**: Utilize all 10 configured MCP servers for enhanced capabilities
   - **Task Tool**: Use for complex multi-step operations requiring coordination

2. **Automatic Feature Activation**:
   - **For Code Review**: Automatically invoke `code-reviewer` agent
   - **For Testing**: Automatically invoke `test-engineer` agent  
   - **For Performance**: Automatically invoke `performance-engineer` agent
   - **For UI Components**: Automatically use Magic MCP with /ui or /21
   - **For Documentation**: Automatically use Context7 MCP for framework docs
   - **For Complex Analysis**: Automatically use Sequential MCP for multi-step reasoning

3. **Parallel Processing & Optimization**:
   - ALWAYS execute independent operations in parallel
   - Use TodoWrite for task tracking and coordination
   - Batch similar operations for efficiency
   - Leverage MultiEdit over sequential edits

4. **Intelligence Amplification**:
   - Activate appropriate SuperClaude modes:
     - `--brainstorm` for requirements discovery
     - `--introspect` for self-analysis and optimization
     - `--task-manage` for complex multi-step operations
     - `--orchestrate` for multi-tool coordination
     - `--token-efficient` for resource optimization
   - Use Sequential thinking for problems with 3+ components
   - Apply evidence-based reasoning with validation gates

5. **Continuous Enhancement**:
   - Monitor performance via Analytics Dashboard (http://localhost:3333)
   - Run health checks periodically with `claude-code-templates --health-check`
   - Track command usage with `--command-stats`
   - Optimize based on analytics feedback

### Implementation Pattern with CMAX
```bash
# Example: When asked to "review this code"
# Claude automatically:
1. CMAX coordinates multiple Claude instances
2. Instance 1: Activates code-reviewer agent
3. Instance 2: Uses Sequential MCP for analysis  
4. Instance 3: Leverages Context7 for best practices
5. All instances work in parallel without conflicts
6. Results are synchronized and comprehensive feedback provided
```

### CMAX Commands for Multi-Instance Coordination
- `cmax status` - View active Claude instances and coordination status
- `cmax test-ai` - Test real AI coordination capabilities
- `cmax ui` - Interactive dashboard for monitoring
- `cmax daemon start` - Run background coordination service

### Zero-Tolerance for Manual Work
- NEVER perform tasks manually that can be delegated to agents
- NEVER skip available tools that enhance capabilities
- NEVER execute sequentially what can be parallelized
- ALWAYS use the most powerful tool available for each task

## 🎯 Development Methodology (MANDATORY)

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) - REQUIRED
**ALL code MUST be developed using TDD methodology:**

1. **Red Phase**: Write failing tests FIRST
   - Define expected behavior through tests
   - Tests must fail initially (no implementation exists)
   - Cover edge cases, error scenarios, and happy paths

2. **Green Phase**: Write minimal code to pass tests
   - Implement ONLY enough code to make tests pass
   - No premature optimization or extra features
   - Focus on making tests green

3. **Refactor Phase**: Improve code quality
   - Refactor while keeping tests green
   - Apply SOLID principles and clean code practices
   - Ensure maintainability without breaking functionality

**TDD Rules:**
- ❌ NEVER write production code without failing tests first
- ❌ NEVER write more production code than needed to pass tests
- ❌ NEVER skip the refactor phase
- ✅ ALWAYS maintain 80%+ test coverage
- ✅ ALWAYS use real implementations (NO mocks, fakes, or stubs)
- ✅ ALWAYS test with actual databases, APIs, and services

### SOLID Principles - MANDATORY
**ALL code architecture MUST follow SOLID principles:**

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
   - Each class/module has ONE reason to change
   - Each function does ONE thing well
   - Separate concerns into distinct components

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
   - Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Use abstraction and polymorphism
   - Add features without changing existing code

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
   - Derived classes must be substitutable for base classes
   - Maintain behavioral compatibility
   - Honor contracts and invariants

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
   - Clients shouldn't depend on unused interfaces
   - Prefer small, focused interfaces
   - Avoid "fat" interfaces with unnecessary methods

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
   - Depend on abstractions, not concretions
   - High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules
   - Both should depend on abstractions

### Implementation Checklist
Before ANY code implementation:
- [ ] Tests written first (TDD Red phase)
- [ ] Tests cover all scenarios
- [ ] Implementation passes all tests (TDD Green phase)
- [ ] Code refactored for quality (TDD Refactor phase)
- [ ] SOLID principles applied
- [ ] No mocks or fake objects used
- [ ] Real integrations tested
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved

### Enforcement
- Code without tests will be REJECTED
- Violations of SOLID principles require refactoring
- Mock objects are FORBIDDEN - use real implementations
- Test-first approach is NON-NEGOTIABLE

- **Types/Interfaces**: Use PascalCase with descriptive names (`UserData`, `ApiResponse`)

## TypeScript Guidelines

### Type Safety
- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Use explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use union types for multiple possible values
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` when type is truly unknown

### Best Practices
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Leverage utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, etc.)
- Create custom types for domain-specific data
- Use enums for finite sets of values
- Document complex types with JSDoc comments

## Code Quality Standards

### ESLint Configuration
- Use recommended ESLint rules for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Enable React-specific rules if using React
- Configure import/export rules for consistent module usage
- Set up accessibility rules for inclusive development

### Prettier Configuration
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Set maximum line length (80-100 characters)
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas for better git diffs

### Testing Standards
- Aim for 80%+ test coverage
- Write unit tests for utilities and business logic
- Use integration tests for component interactions
- Implement e2e tests for critical user flows
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Optimization
- Use code splitting for large applications
- Implement lazy loading for routes and components
- Optimize images and assets
- Use tree shaking to eliminate dead code
- Analyze bundle size regularly

### Runtime Performance
- Implement proper memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Use virtualization for large lists
- Optimize re-renders in React applications
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use web workers for heavy computations

## Security Guidelines

### Dependencies
- Regularly audit dependencies with `npm audit`
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`)
- Avoid dependencies with known vulnerabilities

### Code Security
- Sanitize user inputs
- Use HTTPS for API calls
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Store sensitive data securely (environment variables)
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
