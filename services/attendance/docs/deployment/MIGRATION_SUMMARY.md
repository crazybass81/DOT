// Enhanced admin capabilities
const isMasterAdmin = await supabaseAuthService.isMasterAdmin();
const isApproved = await supabaseAuthService.isApproved();
```

### 3. Approval Workflow Integration
- Existing employee approval system preserved
- Enhanced with Supabase RLS policies
- Master admin controls maintained

### 4. Automated User Migration
```bash
# Migration script capabilities
npm run migrate:users --dry-run           # Preview changes
npm run migrate:users --batch-size=10     # Control migration rate
npm run migrate:stats                     # Monitor progress
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```env
# Supabase Primary Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://mljyiuzetchtjudbcfvd.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Migration Control Flags
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SUPABASE_AUTH=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_MIGRATION_FLOW=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_COGNITO_FALLBACK=true

# Migration Settings
MIGRATION_BATCH_SIZE=5
MIGRATION_DELAY_MS=2000
```

### Database Requirements
- ✅ RLS policies configured
- ✅ Employee table with `auth_user_id` column  
- ✅ Master admin roles supported
- ✅ Approval workflow compatibility

## Migration Execution Plan

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] Install @supabase/supabase-js dependency
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Run database migrations if needed
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Prepare user communication materials

### Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Soft Launch (Week 1)
```typescript
// Enable Supabase for new registrations only
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORCE_SUPABASE_NEW_USERS=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_COGNITO_FALLBACK=true
```

#### Step 2: Gradual User Migration (Week 2)
```bash
# Start with small batches
npm run migrate:users --batch-size=5 --users=pilot-users.txt
```

#### Step 3: Full Migration (Week 3)
```bash
# Migrate remaining users
npm run migrate:users --batch-size=10
```

#### Step 4: Cleanup (Week 4)
```typescript
// Disable legacy systems
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_COGNITO_FALLBACK=false
// Remove Cognito dependencies
```

await unifiedAuthService.enableSupabaseAuth(false);
```

### Rollback Scenarios
1. **Performance Issues**: Revert to Cognito, investigate Supabase config
2. **Authentication Failures**: Enable dual-auth, diagnose issues  
3. **Data Integrity Problems**: Halt migration, audit data consistency
