# Authentication System Troubleshooting Plan

## Problem Analysis
Current Issue: Automatic redirect to /dashboard despite clearing server-side sessions
Root Cause: Browser-side Supabase session persistence in localStorage/sessionStorage

## System Architecture Status
✅ Database Integration: Connected to real Supabase PostgreSQL
✅ Login Page: Functional with validation and error handling  
✅ Signup Page: Functional with email confirmation flow
✅ AuthContext: Real-time authentication state management
✅ Server-side Sessions: Successfully cleared via global logout

## Authentication Flow Design
1. User visits localhost:3002
2. AuthContext.initializeAuth() checks session state
3. If session exists → redirect to role-based dashboard
4. If no session → show login page

## Current Implementation
- SupabaseAuthService: Uses profiles table (bypassing unified_identities RLS)
- AuthContext: Real-time session monitoring with debugging
- HomePage: useEffect redirect logic with console logging
- Login/Signup: GitHub-style UI with form validation

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. Browser session cleanup (localStorage/sessionStorage)
2. Incognito window testing
3. Debug log analysis
4. Session state validation
