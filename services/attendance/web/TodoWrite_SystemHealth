- [ ] 1.1 Database connection health test
- [ ] 1.2 Redis cache connection health test  
- [ ] 1.3 WebSocket connection pool health test
- [ ] 1.4 External API dependency health test
- [ ] 1.5 System resource (CPU/Memory/Disk) health test
- [ ] 1.6 Overall health score calculation test

### Alert System Tests  
- [ ] 2.1 Threshold breach alert trigger test
- [ ] 2.2 Multi-channel notification test (email/websocket/push)
- [ ] 2.3 Alert throttling and deduplication test
- [ ] 2.4 Alert priority and escalation test
- [ ] 2.5 Alert recovery and auto-resolution test

### Integration Monitoring Tests
