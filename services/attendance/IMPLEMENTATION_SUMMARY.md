### 🔄 Architecture Changes Implemented

#### From Express.js to Supabase Edge Functions
**Before:**
```
Express.js → Node.js → MongoDB → REST API
```

**After:**
```
Supabase Edge Functions → Deno → PostgreSQL → REST + Real-time
```

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 **Performance**: Edge Functions run closer to users (CDN edge)
- 💰 **Cost**: Pay-per-use instead of always-on servers
- 🔒 **Security**: Built-in RLS and JWT authentication
- ⚡ **Real-time**: WebSocket support out of the box
- 🛠️ **Maintenance**: Managed infrastructure, automatic scaling

### 📱 Mobile App Updates

#### Key Integration Points
1. **Authentication Flow**
   ```dart
   Supabase.instance.client → JWT token → Edge Functions
   ```

2. **Data Source Implementation**
   ```dart
   SupabaseAttendanceDataSource implements AttendanceRemoteDataSource
   ```

3. **Employee Registration Flow**
   ```
   QR Scan → Registration Form → Pending Approval → Master Admin Review → Access Granted
   ```

### 🗃️ Database Design Highlights

#### Approval Workflow
```sql
employees.approval_status: PENDING → APPROVED/REJECTED
approval_history: Complete audit trail
```

#### Attendance Tracking
```sql
attendance: Daily records with check-in/out
breaks: Multiple breaks per day supported
Working time calculation: Automatic with triggers
```

#### Security Model
- Row Level Security on all tables
- JWT-based authentication
- Master admin privileges
- Department-based access control

### 📈 Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**
   - Spatial indexes for location queries
   - Composite indexes for frequent queries
   - Partial indexes for status filters

2. **Edge Function Optimizations**
   - Dependency injection for service reuse
   - Efficient query patterns
   - Minimal payload sizes
   - Parallel processing where applicable

3. **Mobile App Optimizations**
   - Local caching with LocalStorageService
   - Optimistic UI updates
   - Lazy loading for lists
   - Image optimization
